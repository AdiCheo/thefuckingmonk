hey pendejos

it’s been a wild few weeks

the mix of the outside shitwinds blowing from the political mess that is the united snakes government

knocking into me and making me stumble like a drunk hog monkey

so what do you guys think is gonna happen?

seems the only thing they can both agree on is that the election was corrupt and can’t be trusted

if two kids we playing fucking kickball and they accused eachother of counting the score wrong....

well you’d probably just tell them to play another fucking game

but first you have to establish the rules...

what a fucking mess

each side is convinced the devil is in the other

I wonder which side is more sure of themselves

A bit of skepticism would go a long way in this mess
